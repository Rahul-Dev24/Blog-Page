            <h2>Angular js Update</h2>
            <p class="date">August 10, 2024</p>
            <p>
              Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
              environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
              Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
              code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript
              to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The
              ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to
              generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the
              user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript
              everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development
              around a single programming language, as opposed to using
              different languages for the server- versus client-side
              programming. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of
              asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput
              and scalability in web applications with many input/output
              operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g.,
              real-time communication programs and browser games).[7] The
              Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by
              the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS
              Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is
              facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects
              program.

            <h2>Node js History</h2>
            <p>
              Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[10] about 13
              years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript
              environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[11] The initial release
              supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance
              was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.[12] Dahl criticized
              the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many
              (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant
              programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which
              applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of
              multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.[13] Dahl
              demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on
              November 8, 2009.[14][15][16] Node.js combined Google's V8
              JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.[17]

              In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js
              environment called npm.[18] The package manager allows programmers
              to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying
              source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update
              and uninstallation of packages.[17] In June 2011, Microsoft and
              Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.[19] The
              first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.
              In January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm
              creator Isaac Schlueter.[20] In January 2014, Schlueter announced
              that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.[21] In December
              2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created
              because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an
              open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee.
              The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to
              community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest
              Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's
              approach at that time.[22]

              The Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js
              under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015.[23] The
              merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js
              v3.3 combining into Node v4.0.[24] This merge brought V8 ES6
              features into Node.js and started a long-term support release
              cycle.[25] By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to
              Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively
              ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.[26] In 2019,
              the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS
              Foundation. On September 6, 2023, Node.js 20.6.0 was released. The
              update brought the addition of built-in support for .env files,
              the unflagging of import.meta.resolve, the introduction of a new
              node:module API register for module customization hooks and a new
              initialize hook. Additionally, the module customization load hook
              now supports CommonJS, and Node.js C++ add-ons have gained
              experimental support for cppgc (Oilpan), which is a C++ garbage
              collection library for V8.[27]
